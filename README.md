### GPUIO

GPUIO is a project in the domain of computer graphics and GPU computing, specializing in physics simulations. It harnesses the capabilities of modern GPUs, supporting WebGL 1/2 and GLSL 1/3, and offers the 2 simulation types:

1. Conway's Game of Life: Demonstrates emergent behavior through cellular automata.

2. Julia Set Fractal: Creates intricate fractal art using complex mathematics.

### Conway's Game of Life:
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

### Julia Set Fractal:
In the context of complex dynamics, a branch of mathematics, the Julia set and the Fatou set are two complementary sets (Julia "laces" and Fatou "dusts") defined from a function. Informally, the Fatou set of the function consists of values with the property that all nearby values behave similarly under repeated iteration of the function, and the Julia set consists of values such that an arbitrarily small perturbation can cause drastic changes in the sequence of iterated function values. Thus the behavior of the function on the Fatou set is "regular", while on the Julia set its behavior is "chaotic".
